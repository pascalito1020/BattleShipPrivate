"# BattleShipPrivate" 
Welcome to our newly created game, BattleShip!
The objective of the game is to sink the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

Upon starting, you will be given the option to play against a player (by typing p) or against the computer (by typing c).
You will then be asked to start placing your five ships by:
1. choosing the y and x coordinates (0-9) of the starting point of the ship.
2. choosing your ships' length (1x 5, 1x4, 2x3, 1x2).  
3. choosing in which direction you want to set your ship (starting from the above coordinates, then up, right, down or left).
Once you have done that, your ship will be visible as a row of "1" with your chosen length, and you repeat the process four 
more times. 
Though you could choose other lengths or place ships on top of each other, it would only make the game unfair. So for your 
own sake and fun, please follow the instructions carefully.

When you are playing against the computer, the computer will randomize its ships by itself.
When you are playing against a player, player 2 will repeat the mentioned process.

Once all the ships are placed, a 10x10 board full of "0" will appear. You will start guessing where your enemy's ships
have been placed. If you hit a ship, you will be allowed to play again. Once you miss, it is the opponent's turn.

The first one to sink all five ships of the opponent wins. 

Have a fair, fun and entertaining game, and good luck to all players!
